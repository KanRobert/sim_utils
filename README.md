# sim_utils
`sim_utils` is a collection of utilities to analyze perf data generated by instruction-accurate simulators.

* `test.py` is the pre-commit test.
* Current supported simulator: Intel® SDE
* Requires: Python: 3.9 (or higher), SDE: latest (9.38 or higher)


`sim_utils` is capable of analyzing any workload runnable on Intel® SDE, and amis to support QEMU too.
Personally tested cpu2017, cpuv8, geekbench, coremark-pro and accel2023.

*Usage*:
* Run you workloads on SDE with the suggested command in `cpu2017_collector.py -h`.
* Write and run a collector for your workloads to generate the CSV file to describe the mappings between files. `cpu2017_collector.py` gives an example.
* Then run `copy_files.py`, `for_each.py`, `combine_global_csv.py`, `diff_csv_for_f_wrapper.py`.
* `send_report.py` can help send the data by mail.
